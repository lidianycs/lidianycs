## Research 

As a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science, I am interested in the Software Engineering field, mostly in studying how human aspects (especially **empathy**), can affect software practitioners. Currently I am investigating empathetic practices and its effects in software engineering. 

My latest paper [**Empathy and its Effects on Software Practitionersâ€™ Well-being and Mental Health**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475379) explores how practicing empathy in software engineering can impact software practitionersâ€™ well-being and mental health. 

If you have any questions or are interested in contributing to my next studies, please don't hesitate to contact me:
