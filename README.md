## Hi There!   <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>


:woman_technologist: I have a PhD in Computer Science from the Federal University of Bahia (Salvador, Brazil), with a visiting research period at Virginia Commonwealth University (Richmond, United States). Using mixed-methods approaches, my research focuses on the human aspects of software engineering, particularly empathy, team dynamics, developers' well-being, productivity, and inclusion. I have over 15 years of industry experience as a software engineer, working for a startup company and at large government institutions.
